## What is `ng-di-analyzer`?

`ng-di-analyzer` is a blazing-fast CLI tool written in Rust that statically analyzes Angular projects to construct a full **Dependency Injection (DI) tree** and identify all **possible paths** that could lead to runtime `NullInjectorError`'s.

Angular's DI system is powerful‚Äîbut also brittle. In large applications, it‚Äôs easy to misconfigure providers or forget to add them in the right context. The result? A frustrating and often hard-to-reproduce `NullInjectorError` at runtime.

This tool shifts that pain to **compile time**.

## Why use it?

- ‚úÖ Catch `NullInjectorError`s **before** they happen.
- ‚ö° Rust-powered speed: Analyze large Angular codebases in seconds.
- üß© Understand your DI graph like never before.
- üîç Output all potential injection paths leading to errors.
